Answers to questions

(c) The VWAP ema goes unstable when the magnitude of intenstiies are small
    because the effective first moment of VWAP smoother is

        M*[n] = M1 * B[n-1] / b[n]

    which grows to infinity as the weighting series b[n] vanishes.

(d) VWAP ema series is as smooth as the ema series, while VWAP series tracks
    the original price series more closely than the ema series when the 
    intensity series b[n] level is above its local average, and more loosely
    when b[n] is below its local average.

    On the other hand, the usual ema series has no accelerating mechanism.
