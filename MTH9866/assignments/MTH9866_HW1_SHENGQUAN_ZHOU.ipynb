    "> Depending on the client's typical behavior (buy or sell), or if the client is typically right about market direction in the past (informative trader or noise trader) over a time frame consistent with the dealer's risk holding period, the dealer might want to adjust the quote prices accordingly."

    "The primary reason for the vast increase in the daily turnover in the FX markets in the past fifteen years is the process of shifting trading activities to electronic markets. Electronic trading leads to more transparency in prices, lower transaction costs, and lower bid/ask spreads, which encourages greater market participation and higher trading volumes. In addition, the following factors also contributed to the increase:\n",

The price-making engine at the dealer receives the request for quote and looks at the inter-dealer electronic market, the risk position of the electronic book, includes any short-term market direction bias (either manually-specified or determined algorithmically), and includes any bias due to historical trading behavior of the client. It calculates bid and ask prices and sends them back to the client. The results update as those four inputs change through time.\n",
    ">3. The client sees the prices in their application and, if he/she wants to trade, clicks to buy at the offer or sell at the bid.\n",
    ">4. The dealer receives the trade request and executes the trade. The trade request might still be rejected if the market has moved sufficiently far since the original quote."
