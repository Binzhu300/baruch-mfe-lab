About the delta in application1 f), different shift in underlying price makes material differences to the delta derived. Just a note here.
Sorry your last question email got buried in others and didn't give you a timely reply. I hope it doesn't hold you too long for the HW.

After a semester's hard work, I wish you all a great time at final and a fabulous Christmas.

Regards,
Susan
