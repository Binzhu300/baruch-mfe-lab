Application i): the interpretation of the model parameters is more like intuitively, "can solve solve beta_0 and beta_1 setting t to 0 and infinity" is not a suitable answer for this.
Application v): the question ask for "return" on each cash flow and portfolio. You compared the PV of each scenario, as a result, the graph doesn't look right then. But I checked the return based on your PVs, it looks fine. So I only deduct two points here.
 
I'm glad to see you used the curve class in your code, it shows that you put an effort on reading sandBox.
The whole design of your homework is really good, I want to share the screenshot for the exercises part as a sample on the forum later.
 
Keep up the good work!
 
Cheers,
